# Voices for Choice
 by Emily Cabello

# project overview
 This project is a website to promote the fictional social justice festival "Voices for Choice." The festival aims to provide resources, support, and education on reproductive rights and reproductive healthcare. This is done through coordinated hands-on events to build community, panels featuring qualified guest speakers such as politicians and healthcare professionals, and performances by outspoken artists who support the cause. 
 The focus of this project comes as many Americans, specifically women, fear for their reproductive rights and bodily autonomy post Roe v. Wade overturn. Trump's impending second term will be full of conservative figures and values that seek to take away women's rights to their own bodies and health. Promises for strict  bans and restricted acess to abortion care is denying women healthcare. Because of the possible changes on a federal level, as well as the millions of people living in states where there is already strict abortion laws, it's important to provide aid to those affected and spread awareness so that these rights aren't further encroached on. The festival is supported by the organization Center for Reproductive Rights. It takes place in Chicago because Illinois is a more liberal state in terms of reproductive rights than its surrounding states, making it a safehaven for people from bordering states who need to access this health care.
